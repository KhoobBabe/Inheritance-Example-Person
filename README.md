# Inheritance-Example-Person

A class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee are created. 
Faculty and Staff are subclasses of Employee. 
A person has a name, address, phone number, and email address. 
A student has a class status (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior). The status is defined as a constant.
An employee has an office, salary, and date hired. 
A faculty member has office hours and a rank. 
A staff member has a title. 

The toString() method in each class is Overridden to display the class name and the personâ€™s name.

A test program is given that creates a Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff, and invokes their toString() methods.
